# CRM_DATA_CHAMPION_PROJECT
This repository contains my CRM Data Champion project — a written analysis on marketing channels, CAC, and LTV.


## Part 1: Channel Performance Analysis

After reviewing the CRM data, I found that the Email marketing channel is underperforming compared to social media and paid ads.

Reasons:
- Very few customers open or click on the emails.  
- The same message is sent to everyone, which makes it less interesting.  
- Emails are sent at times when customers are less active.  

Because of this, the email channel has a high Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and brings fewer conversions.

## Part 2: Experiments to Improve Conversion or Reduce Cost

To make the email channel perform better, I suggest two experiments:

### Experiment 1: Personalized Email Campaigns
- Segment customers by interest, age, or past purchases.  
- Send customized emails with offers that fit their needs.  
  Expected result: Higher open and click rate - lower CAC.  

### Experiment 2: A/B Testing on Email Timing and Subject Lines
- Send the same email at different times (morning vs evening).  
- Use different subject lines to test which one attracts more users.  
Expected result: Better engagement and conversion.  

## Part 3: CAC:LTV Tracking Dashboard

To track the company’s marketing health, I would create a simple CAC:LTV Dashboard with these metrics:

| **Metric** | **Meaning** | **Frequency** |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Total marketing spend ÷ new customers | Weekly |
| LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) | Average revenue per customer × retention time | Monthly |
| Conversion Rate | Leads converted ÷ total leads | Weekly |
| Retention Rate | % of customers who buy again | Monthly |
| ROI by Channel | (Revenue – Spend) ÷ Spend | Weekly |

**Who views it weekly:**
- Marketing Team  
- Data Analysts  
- Management Team  

This dashboard helps everyone see which channels are working and where costs can be reduced.

## Part 4: Strategic Summary (Max 200 Words)

My philosophy in designing marketing funnels is to focus on **customer behavior first and system design second**.  
A well-built funnel should understand real human emotions — what motivates a person to click, explore, and buy.

While **data gives structure**, **human unpredictability gives meaning**. That’s why I balance both:  
I use data to test, measure, and automate, but I rely on empathy to create experiences customers love.

**Data storytelling** plays a key role — it helps turn numbers into insights that inspire real decisions.  
When leaders understand data in a story form, they act faster and smarter.

Finally, I believe **AI tools like ChatGPT** are not for replacing thinking but for **enhancing creativity and saving time**, allowing us to focus on the “why” behind customer actions.
